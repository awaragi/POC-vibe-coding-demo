# Demo Vibe - AI-Powered App Prototyping

A demonstration framework for rapid app prototyping using AI agents. This project showcases a structured approach to designing and implementing functional prototypes through guided discovery and automated development.

## Overview

This repository contains AI agent prompts and case studies for building demo-ready applications in minutes rather than days. The workflow separates design discovery from implementation, enabling efficient collaboration between product thinking and development execution.

## Structure

- **Agents/** - AI agent prompt templates
  - `analysis-agent.md` - Interactive discovery and specification generation
  - `implement-agent.md` - Autonomous implementation from specifications
  
- **Cases/** - Example use cases and requirements
  - `crm-case-01.md` - CRM opportunity pipeline application

## Workflow

1. **Discovery Phase**: Use the analysis agent to interactively define app requirements, screens, and user flows
2. **Specification**: Generate a detailed specification document with implementation steps
3. **Development Phase**: Use the implement agent to build the working prototype
4. **Demo**: Run and test the functional application

## Key Features

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Go from concept to working demo in under 30 minutes
- **Structured Discovery**: Focused questions that define requirements efficiently
- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Testable increments with clear validation
- **Demo-Ready Output**: Polished applications suitable for executive presentations
